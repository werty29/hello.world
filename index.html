      <p>Welcome! This is the first website that I have ever made where I wrote 100% of the code (except for bootstrap). Please take a look around and let me know what you think!

    <p style="margin-right:150px;">Give me 3 month and I can learn any programming language.
    </p>
    <p>At its heart, coding is expression and problem solving. You can focus on its applications, on programming languages, but no matter how you practice it, you will cultivate these two essential skills, which will help you in all aspects of life. These are skills that i am honing and devoloping.
  </p>
</div>
    <h2>1) Language</h2>
      <p>The cornerstone of programing is obviously knowing a programming language. I have experience with HTML javascript and python although I will never stop learning. Always growing in my knowledge of the language I know while acquiring new skills.  </P>
    <h2>2) Self-Reliance</h2>
      <p>Sometimes Programming can be difficult and feel overwhelming and finding a place to start can feel impossible. That's where I take responsibility and take on projects like eating an elephant. One bite at a time. I will take on the responsibility of being motivated and going the extra mile because I know no one influences my life more than me.</P>
    <h2>3) Logic</h2>
      <p>Being able to look at code and analytically go through it to problem solve and debug is what I do best. or should I say having code the needs debugging is something that I frequently deal with. </P>
    <h2>4) Recognition of Stupidity</h2>
      <p>Computers can be stupid in the aspect of they do exactly what they are told. they have no ability to learn or create... yet. As a [rogrammer I will bring creativity to the table and show the computer what to do.</P>
    <h2>5) Attention to Detail</h2>
      <p>Many coders did not go to school for programming. There are different ways to measure aptitude for coding, but nothing can substitute the effort a person makes. As a programmer, I am ready to work hard and put in 100% effort into all of my projects</P>
